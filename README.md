Zeroed in 2025:Mapping the road to netzero to earth?

**Overview:**

The UK government has committed to achieving Net Zero carbon emissions, a goal that requires transformative changes across all sectors of society. Local Authorities (LAs) play a pivotal role in this transition, as they directly manage transport systems, housing development, waste services, and local industriesâ€”each contributing significantly to emissions.applying statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning models, this project aims to provide data-driven insights that can inform policy, guide funding, and support regional climate action strategies.This project addresses the dual challenge of climate goals and economic development at the local level in the UK.
The aims for this project consist of:

1.Net Zero Readiness: Can we predict which local authorities are on track to reach Net Zero by 2050 based on historical emissions?

2.Economic Linkages: Can we uncover patterns between carbon emissions and economic indicators like business density and Gross Value Added (GVA) by industry?

The analysis focuses on local authorities within the Yorkshire and the Humber region.
